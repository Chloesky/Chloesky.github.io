I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [National Institute on Drug Dependence](https://nidd.bjmu.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest lies in exploring the cognitive neural mechanisms of mental illness. I'm currently working on identifying EEG-based biomarkers for substance use disorder and tracking disease trajectory.
