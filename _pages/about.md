**December 2025 Update:**
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the National Institute on Drug Dependence, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest lies in exploring the cognitive neural mechanisms of mental illness. I'm currently working on identifying EEG-based biomarkers for Substance Use Disorder and tracking disease trajectory.
